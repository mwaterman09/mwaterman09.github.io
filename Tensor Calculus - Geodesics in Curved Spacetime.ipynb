    "### Introduction  \n",
    "According to Einstein's theory of General Relativity, the gravity we see acting on an object is the manifestation of spacetime curvature around a massive object rather than a physical force. In the absence of external forces, objects in motion in the presence of a massive body follow the straightest path through the curved space. These paths are called *geodesics*, and the equation of the paths of such an object is called the *geodesic equation*.  \n",

The Christoffel symbol is a collection of coefficients which represent the curvature of a surface and will be defined later. In this and all subsequent expressions the Einstein summation convention will be used, which is to say that wherever an index is repeated in one upper and one lower position, a summation over that index is implied. and the sigma will be omitted.

    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "We have therefore shown that the geodesic equation satisfies the criteria for an extremal value by using the Euler-Lagrange equations. This equation when solved for a set of initial values and a particular metric tensor describing the space, provides the equations for an object in motion through the space. The equation may be viewed as an extension of Newton's second law. The first term is the second derivative of the position coordinates, which we know as acceleration. The second term is equal and opposite the first term and describes the curvature of the space along an arc length. \n",
    "\n",
    "We may interpret the equation as the statement that the acceleration of an object subject to no external forces is equal and opposite to the curvature of the space in which it travels. This important result means that even under no external forces, a body moving in curved space experiences a nonzero acceleration. This is how gravity works."
